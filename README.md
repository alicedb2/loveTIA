# <p align="center">:heart:TIA</p>

This is a stripped down version of the [MIDIbox TIA]. 

We control the Atari 2600 TIA chip with a Raspberry Pi Pico. The clock signal to the TIA is given by a PIO state machine instead of a crystal. Modulation of the state machine frequency allows the TIA to output a continuous pitch instead of the original 32 pitches.
