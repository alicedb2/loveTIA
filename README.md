# :heart:TIA - Voltage Controlled TIA chip

[![vcTIA - Atari 2600 TIA and Arduino](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jGm9PULHrRM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGm9PULHrRM) (not current)

Pico controlled Atari 2600 TIA chip. The oscillator is mimicked by a PIO state machine. Modulation of the clock frequency of the state machine allows the TIA to output (almost) any audio frequency beyond the its original 32 frequencies.
